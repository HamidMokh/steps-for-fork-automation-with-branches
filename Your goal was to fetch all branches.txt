Your goal was to fetch all branches from the original repository (https://github.com/ZhangMYihua/crwn-clothing-v2.git) into your forked repository (https://github.com/HamidMokh/crwn-clothing-v2.git) on GitHub.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how we achieved this:

1. **Forking the Repository:**
   - You forked the original repository (upstream) into your GitHub account, creating your forked repository.

2. **Cloning the Forked Repository:**
   - You cloned your forked repository (`https://github.com/HamidMokh/crwn-clothing-v2.git`) to your local machine using the command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/HamidMokh/crwn-clothing-v2.git
     ```

3. **Adding Upstream Remote:**
   - You added the original repository as a remote named `upstream` using the command:
     ```bash
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/ZhangMYihua/crwn-clothing-v2.git
     ```

4. **Fetching Branches:**
   - You fetched all branches from the original repository using the command:
     ```bash
     git fetch upstream
     ```

5. **Creating Local Branches:**
   - You looped through each remote branch, creating a local branch that tracks the remote branch using the following script:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash

     # Set your forked repository URL
     forked_repo="https://github.com/HamidMokh/crwn-clothing-v2.git"

     # Set the remote repository URL
     remote_repo="https://github.com/ZhangMYihua/crwn-clothing-v2.git"

     # Clone your forked repository
     git clone $forked_repo

     # Change into the cloned repository directory
     cd crwn-clothing-v2

     # Add the remote repository with the URL of the original repository
     git remote add upstream $remote_repo

     # Fetch branches from the remote repository
     git fetch upstream

     # Get a list of all remote branches
     remote_branches=$(git branch -r | grep -v '\->' | awk -F '/' '{print $2}')

     # Loop through each remote branch and create a local branch tracking the remote branch
     for branch in $remote_branches; do
         git checkout -b $branch --track upstream/$branch
     done

     # Print a message indicating the process is complete
     echo "All branches fetched and checked out successfully!"
     ```

   - This script automates the process of creating local branches for all remote branches.

6. **Executing the Script:**
   - You executed the script by saving it to a file (e.g., `fetch-branches.sh`) and running it in the terminal.

7. **Result:**
   - All branches from the original repository were fetched, and local branches tracking each of them were created in your forked repository.

In summary, the provided script automates the process of fetching and creating local branches for all branches from the original repository, streamlining the workflow and saving time compared to manually creating each branch.
